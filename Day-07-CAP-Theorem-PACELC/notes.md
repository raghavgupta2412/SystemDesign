## Why CAP exists
The whole reason this theorem exists is that we put data on more than one machine in the first place. We do
that for fault tolerance — keeping **replicas** (extra copies of the same data on other servers) so that one
dead machine doesn't kill the app.

But the moment you have copies on separate machines, two new problems appear: the nodes can **disagree**
(one got a write the other hasn't seen yet), and the **network between them can fail** (cables cut, switches
die, packets lost). CAP is simply the name for the unavoidable trade-off you face when that network failure
happens. It's not abstract math for its own sake — it's describing what physically *must* go wrong.

## The 3 letters
CAP stands for three properties you'd love to have all at once. Define each one precisely, because the exact
wording is where people trip:

- **C — Consistency:** every read returns the **most recent write** — i.e. all nodes show the same data
  *right now*. If you just wrote "balance = ₹500", any read from any node immediately returns ₹500, never an
  older ₹700.
  - ⚠️ **This is NOT ACID's "C".** ACID-C (from databases, Day 5) means "a transaction never violates a rule
    like 'debits must equal credits'." CAP-C means something different: **"all replicas agree on the latest
    value right now."** Same letter, different concept — don't mix them up.
- **A — Availability:** every request gets a **non-error response** — the system answers, even if the answer
  might be a little **stale** (out of date). "I always reply" — not "I always reply *correctly*."
- **P — Partition tolerance:** the system **keeps working even when the network between nodes fails**. A
  "partition" is when nodes can't talk to each other — the cluster is split into islands that can't sync.

## The theorem (state it precisely)
> **During a network partition (P), you must choose between C and A. You cannot have both DURING a partition.**

Why? Picture node A and node B, normally syncing. The link between them dies (partition). A write arrives at
A. A has two options: tell B before confirming (impossible — B is unreachable, so A would have to **block**
and refuse → loses *availability*), or confirm without B (now A and B disagree → loses *consistency*).
There's no third door while the link is down.

- ⭐ **KEY NUANCE — you do NOT "pick 2 of 3".** In any real distributed system, **P is mandatory**: networks
  fail whether you like it or not, so you can't opt out of partition tolerance. That means the real choice
  isn't "which two of C/A/P" — it's narrower and more specific: **C vs A, and only during a partition.**
  - When there's **no partition** (the normal, healthy state — which is *most* of the time), you happily get
    **both C and A**. CAP only describes behavior **during a failure**, not all the time. This is the single
    most misunderstood point about the theorem.

## During a partition — what each choice actually does
Concrete setup: Node A can't reach Node B (partition), and a write lands on A. A must decide:

- **CP (choose Consistency):** A **refuses or blocks** the request rather than risk being out of sync. Result:
  the data stays correct everywhere, but A is **unavailable** — the user gets an error or a hang.
  - Motto: *"Better an error than a wrong answer."*
- **AP (choose Availability):** A **accepts the write (or serves a read) anyway**, knowing its data may be
  **stale** relative to B. Result: A keeps answering, but the two sides are now **inconsistent**; you
  **reconcile later** once the link heals (this is where **eventual consistency** — copies agree
  *eventually*, not instantly — comes from).
  - Motto: *"Better a stale answer than no answer."*

## The 3 combinations (CP / AP / CA)
- **CP** — sacrifices **availability** during a partition to stay consistent.
  - Examples: HBase, MongoDB (default config), Zookeeper, etcd, clustered relational databases (RDBMS).
- **AP** — sacrifices **consistency** during a partition to stay available.
  - Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak, CouchDB.
- **CA** — **not achievable in a real distributed system**, because you can't magically prevent partitions.
  A single, non-distributed node can be called "CA" only trivially — and that's cheating, because it isn't
  distributed at all (more on why this is a trap below).

## Mapping to decisions — choose by CONSEQUENCE
The right letter isn't a matter of taste; it follows from **how bad wrong data is** for that feature:

- **CP** when wrong/stale data is catastrophic: **banking, payments, inventory counts, seat-booking.** Selling
  the same airplane seat twice or showing a wrong balance is unacceptable, so you'd rather refuse than err.
- **AP** when staleness is harmless but downtime hurts: **social feeds, like counts, DNS, adding to a cart.**
  A like count that's briefly off, or a feed half a second behind, is fine; being *down* loses users.

## PACELC — the upgrade that impresses
CAP only talks about the partition case. **PACELC** extends it to cover *normal* operation too, which is
where your system actually spends most of its life:

> **If Partition (P): choose A vs C. Else (E, normal operation): choose Latency (L) vs Consistency (C).**

The insight: **even with NO partition, there's still a trade-off** — between **latency** (speed) and
consistency. Here's why, concretely:
- **Strong consistency** means a write must **wait for multiple replicas to confirm** it before returning →
  the user waits longer → higher **latency**.
- **Low latency** means you **return before all replicas confirm** → faster, but a read might catch a replica
  that hasn't received the write yet → **stale read**.

So you're trading speed against correctness *all the time*, not just during failures.

- ⭐ **ALWAYS answer BOTH halves of a PACELC class** — the "P..." part and the "E..." part. Dropping one half
  is a classic mistake (it cost me points in Q4).
- Classes to know:
  - **Cassandra / DynamoDB = PA/EL** — on **P**artition choose **A**vailability; **E**lse choose **L**atency.
    Speed and uptime first, both during failures and normal operation.
  - **MongoDB = PA/EC** (tunable) — on partition choose Availability; **E**lse choose **C**onsistency.
  - **RDBMS / Google Spanner = PC/EC** — **C**onsistency always. The cost: it gives up availability during a
    partition, and accepts higher latency during normal operation, all to never be wrong.

## Myths to NEVER repeat
Each of these is a trap an interviewer is hoping you'll fall into:

- ❌ **"Pick any 2 of 3 freely."** No — P is mandatory, so the only real choice is **C vs A, and only during
  a partition.**
- ❌ **"My distributed system is CA."** Not real — you can't avoid partitions, so true CA doesn't exist in a
  distributed system.
- ❌ **"CAP applies all the time."** No — it only describes behavior **during a partition.** (That's exactly
  the gap PACELC was invented to fill.)
- ❌ **Confusing CAP-C with ACID-C.** CAP-C = "all replicas agree on the latest value now"; ACID-C =
  "transactions don't break data rules." Different things.

## ⭐ The "CA single server" trap (Q5 — answer it, don't deflect)
Someone calls a single-server Postgres "CA" (consistent + available, no partitions). It's tempting to nod —
but it's **wrong**, for two reasons:

1. **CAP only applies to DISTRIBUTED systems.** One node has no replicas and no network between nodes, so
   there are no partitions to tolerate — calling it "CA" is meaningless, like grading a swimmer on their
   cycling.
2. **A single server is the OPPOSITE of available.** It's a **SPOF** (single point of failure, Day 1): if
   that one machine dies, availability drops to **zero.** Calling it "highly available" is backwards.

The deeper lesson: **true availability REQUIRES redundancy → which requires being distributed → which forces
the real C-vs-A choice.** You can't escape CAP by refusing to distribute; you just trade the C-vs-A dilemma
for a SPOF, which is worse.

## ⭐ Offline ATM = AP banking (follow-up — RESOLVED)
A puzzle: banking is supposed to be CP, yet an offline ATM that keeps dispensing cash during a network outage
is behaving as **AP.** Why is that the *right* call, and how is it made safe?

**WHY it's AP:** a working ATM has real business value — happy customers, money moving. Compare the
alternatives: every ATM in a region going **dead** during a brief network blip is *worse* for the bank than a
rare, **bounded** loss from someone overdrawing. ⭐ **CAP choices follow the money, not dogma.** The very same
bank is **CP for online transfers** (where a double-spend is catastrophic) but **AP at the ATM** — the choice
is made **per-feature**, not once for the whole company.

**HOW it's made safe — bound the blast radius:** during the outage, the ATM enforces a **local offline
withdrawal limit** (e.g. ₹10,000) with **no coordination** with other nodes. Coordination is impossible
anyway — you can't lock an account across machines when the network linking them is down (that's the whole
definition of a partition).
- NB on wording: it's an **"offline limit", NOT a "lock."** A global lock would need the very network that's
  broken; a local cap needs nothing but the ATM itself.

**Reconcile when back online:** the offline transactions are **queued/logged locally**, then **replayed
centrally** when connectivity returns, so all copies **converge** (eventual consistency). If an account ends
up overdrawn, the bank charges an **overdraft fee** or recovers the money **after the fact.**

**The principle:** make an AP design "safe enough" by **bounding the worst case + reconciling after the
network heals** — i.e. **DETECT + RECOVER instead of PREVENT.** Prevention (refusing all withdrawals) was
simply too expensive here, because its cost is availability — the one thing the ATM most needs.

## Personal Notes (recurring gaps)
- [ ] Answer EVERY part of a multi-part question (dropped "PA" half of PACELC in Q4).
- [ ] Don't ask a clarifying question whose answer is already in the prompt (Q5) — answer it.
- [ ] Watch wording precision ("can't have both DURING a partition", not "can have both").
- [x] CP/AP classification by consequence = 3/3, strong ✅. ATM double-spend risk spotted ✅.
