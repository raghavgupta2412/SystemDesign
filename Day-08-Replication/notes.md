# Day 8 — Replication
**Phase 1: Foundations** | Score: 7/10

> **One-sentence idea:** Replication = keep the SAME data on more than one machine, so you survive a

## Why replicate (3 reasons)
1. **Survival** — your one DB server dying = your app dying (the SPOF, Day 1). Copies let someone else take over.
2. **Read scaling** — one server answers only so many "show me this profile" reads/sec. 10 copies ≈ 10× read capacity.
3. **Speed for far users** — a copy in India answers an Indian user faster than reaching a US server.

The easy part is copying. The hard part is **keeping copies in sync while writes keep arriving.**

## A. Who is allowed to WRITE? — the 3 topologies
"Topology" = the shape of who-talks-to-whom. Three shapes:

### 1. Single-leader (master-slave / primary-replica) — ⭐ THE DEFAULT
Picture **one head chef** who alone writes into the master order-book; everyone else gets a **copy** of each order.
- ALL writes (create/update/delete) go to **one leader**. The leader streams each change to the **followers**.
- **Reads** can come from any server — leader or follower.
- Why default: simple, and never any confusion about "which version is true" — the leader IS the truth.
  Perfect for apps that read far more than they write (most apps).
- Catch: every write funnels through one leader, and if it dies you need a **failover** plan.

### 2. Multi-leader (master-master)
**Two head chefs in two cities**, each allowed to write, each copying orders to the other.
- More than one server accepts writes. Use: **multi-region writes**, or offline-capable apps (phone calendar with no signal, syncs later).
- The big catch: if both chefs edit the **same order** at once → two "truths" → a **write conflict** to resolve (Section F).

### 3. Leaderless (Dynamo-style: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak)
**No chef in charge.** The writer writes onto **several desks directly**; a reader checks **several desks** and picks the freshest.
- Built for maximum uptime. The "who's right?" logic moves to the client/coordinator via **quorums** (Section E).

> Beginner anchor: default to **single-leader**. Multi-leader and leaderless are tools you reach for under
> specific pressure (multi-region writes, extreme availability).

---

## B. When does the leader say "OK"? — sync vs async
A write hits the leader. It can reply "saved!" at two different moments — a real trade-off:
- **Synchronous** — leader WAITS for a follower to confirm, then says OK.
  - 👍 Safe: leader dies right after → the follower already has it, nothing lost.
  - 👎 Slow + fragile: if that follower is down/slow, the user's write **hangs**. You've tied your speed to your slowest copy.
- **Asynchronous** — leader says OK **immediately**, ships to followers in the background.
  - 👍 Fast, always responsive.
  - 👎 Leader dies in the background gap → those un-shipped writes are **GONE**.
  - ⭐ This gap is *literally where "eventual consistency" comes from* — copies are right *eventually*, not instantly.
- **Semi-synchronous** — wait for **just ONE** follower, let the rest go async. "At least one safe copy" without
  waiting on all of them. **The practical production default.**

### ⭐ MY Q1 MISTAKE: for read-heavy at scale, pick ASYNC / semi-sync — NOT full sync.
- Sync-to-all means every write blocks on the slowest of many replicas → slow + fragile.
- **The tell:** if everything were sync there'd be **no lag** → so the Q2 lag bug couldn't even happen.
  Choosing "sync everywhere" (Q1) and then fixing a "lag bug" (Q2) **contradict each other.**
  Right move: async, and hide lag only where a user observes their own action.

---

## C. The copies run BEHIND — replication lag & its 3 visible bugs
With async, followers trail the leader by ms→sec. That delay = **replication lag**. Usually invisible — but
three situations make it visible to a user, each with a standard fix. (Interviewers love these.)

**Bug 1 — "Where did my own change go?" → Read-your-own-writes (read-after-write)**
You change your profile photo (write → leader), reload instantly (read → a follower half a second behind) → it
still shows the **old** photo. You think the upload failed.
- **Fix:** for a short window after a user writes, send **THAT user's reads to the leader** (always has the latest).
  Everyone else tolerates the tiny lag.

**Bug 2 — "Time went backwards" → Monotonic reads**
You refresh twice fast. First refresh hits an up-to-date follower → shows a new comment. Second hits a more-behind
follower → the comment **vanishes**. Data moved backward in time.
- **Fix:** **pin** each user to ONE follower (e.g. hash userID → replica). Might be slightly behind, but never goes backward.

**Bug 3 — "Answer before the question" → Consistent prefix reads**
Two causally-linked writes (a question, then its answer) travel different paths and arrive out of order → reader
sees the answer appear before the question.
- **Fix:** keep causally-related writes on the **same partition** so their order is preserved.

> Pattern across all three: lag only hurts when a user observes **their own action** or a **cause→effect sequence**.
> That's exactly when you spend effort to hide it.
> ⚠️ Q2 LESSON: the photo bug is **read-your-own-writes**, NOT monotonic reads.
> read-your-writes = miss your OWN write; monotonic = data you saw goes BACKWARD. Don't swap the names.

## D. The leader died — failover, and the scary failure
**Failover** = promote a follower to new leader when the old one dies. Steps:
1. **Detect** it's gone (heartbeats stopped). 2. **Pick** the most caught-up follower (least lag → least data loss).
3. **Promote** it + point writes at it.

Two things go wrong:
- **Lost writes** — with async, the most caught-up follower may *still* be missing the dead leader's final writes →
  gone. (Mitigate with semi-sync: at least one other copy always had it.)
- ⭐ **SPLIT-BRAIN (the catastrophic one — I MISSED THIS in Q3):**
  The old leader wasn't actually dead — just **network-partitioned** (Day 7). You promoted a new leader. Now the old
  one returns still believing it's leader → **TWO leaders both accepting writes → diverging, corrupt data.**
  - **Prevention — two ideas together:**
    - **Quorum (majority vote):** a node can only become leader if a **majority** agrees. In a split, only the
      majority side can elect one; the lonely old leader can't get votes → can't keep ruling.
    - **Fencing token:** each new leader gets an ever-**increasing** number (#5 → #6…). The storage layer remembers
      the highest it's seen and **rejects** any write stamped with an older number → the stale old leader is denied.

---

## E. Leaderless quorums — the overlap math ⭐ (Q4 — I got 4/4)
No single "truth" node, so correctness comes from **overlap**:
- **N** = total copies of each item. **W** = copies that must confirm a WRITE. **R** = copies you READ + compare.
- ⭐ **THE RULE: `W + R > N`** → the write-set and read-set are **guaranteed to share ≥1 node** → that shared node
  has the latest write → your read can't miss it.
- **Why, concretely (N=3, W=2, R=2):** 2+2=4 > 3. There's no way to choose 2 to write and 2 to read without at
  least one node landing in BOTH groups — and that node holds the fresh value. ✅
- **Tuning the dials:** fast writes → lower W, raise R; fast reads → raise W, lower R; balanced → W=R=majority
  ((N/2)+1), i.e. N=3 → W=2,R=2.
- **Self-healing of stale copies:**
  - **Read repair** — on a read, notice a stale replica → quietly write the fresh value back to it.
  - **Anti-entropy** — a background janitor constantly compares copies and fixes differences.
  - **Hinted handoff** — target node down? another node holds the write as a "hint" and delivers it on the node's return.

---

## F. Concurrent edits clash — conflict resolution (Q5 — correct ✅)
Only an issue in multi-leader & leaderless (single-leader never has two writers).
- **LWW (Last Write Wins)** — keep the newer timestamp, drop the other. ⚠️ **silently deletes** someone's work,
  and "newer" is unreliable when server clocks disagree (clock skew).
- **Vector clocks / version vectors** — bookkeeping that tells you if two writes were *truly simultaneous*
  (a real conflict) vs one came after the other. Honest detection instead of guessing.
- **CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) — data types (counters, sets) **designed to merge automatically**,
  no data loss. How Google-Docs-style collaboration works.
- **App-level merge** — hand both versions to the app, like resolving a Git merge conflict.

---

## Extras (be aware)
- **How changes physically travel:** statement-based (replay SQL — fragile: `NOW()`, randomness) /
  WAL-physical (ship the Write-Ahead Log byte-for-byte — version-coupled) / **logical row-based** ("row 7's photo
  column → X" — decoupled, enables **CDC = Change Data Capture**: stream DB changes to other systems; Day 11/19).
  Builds on Day 5's WAL.
- **Chain replication** (just know it exists): writes enter the **head**, flow down the chain, reads served from
  the **tail** → strong consistency + high throughput.

## Real-system map
- **Postgres / MySQL** → single-leader + read replicas (semi-sync option).
- **Galera / MySQL Group Replication** → multi-leader.
- **Cassandra / DynamoDB / Riak** → leaderless + quorums.

---

## ⭐ Follow-ups (RESOLVED)

### F-1. Why does adding READ replicas hurt WRITE performance? (even though writes didn't increase)
- The leader is a **single fan-out point / broadcast station**: it must personally ship every change to **every**
  follower. 5 replicas = send it 5×, 20 replicas = send it 20× → **O(N) work per write** on one machine
  (outbound bandwidth + CPU to serialize/push + one connection/thread per follower).
- So even with the *same number of writes*, the **cost per write** climbs as replicas pile up → leader saturates →
  write latency rises. (NB: this happens even with ASYNC — it's the *sending* cost, not waiting for consistency.)
- **Fixes — why you can't scale reads forever with flat replicas:**
  1. **Cascading / chained replication** — replicas replicate from *other replicas* (a tree). Leader feeds only 2–3
     nodes; they feed the next layer → leader's fan-out stays small.
  2. **Cache reads** (Day 3, Redis) → need fewer replicas.
  3. **Shard** (Day 9) → each leader owns a slice → fewer total writes + fewer replicas each.

### F-2. Multi-region semi-sync: Tokyo write blocked ~150ms waiting on a US follower — keep writes fast w/o losing durability?
- ⭐ **Region-local durability:** semi-sync only needs **ONE** follower ack — and YOU choose which. Put at least one
  replica in the **SAME region as the leader**, and make *that local replica* the one semi-sync waits on (~1ms,
  same datacenter). Cross-region replicas stay **async** (catch up in the background; user never waits on them).
- This **decouples** "is it safely persisted?" (answered locally, fast) from "is it everywhere on Earth?"
  (eventual, background). The WAN is the expensive part → never block on it.
- This is exactly how **Spanner / CockroachDB** keep global writes fast: quorum within a nearby zone, async across continents.

## Personal Notes (recurring gaps)
- [ ] **Answer what's ASKED:** Q3 asked the *catastrophic* failure → **split-brain**; I gave only lost writes.
- [ ] **Naming precision:** read-your-own-writes ≠ monotonic reads (mislabeled Q2).
- [ ] **Internal consistency:** don't pick "sync" in Q1 then solve a "lag" bug in Q2 — they contradict.
- [x] **Quorum math W+R>N = 4/4, perfect** ✅. CRDT for conflict ✅. Fan-out + region-local durability follow-ups ✅ (senior-level).
